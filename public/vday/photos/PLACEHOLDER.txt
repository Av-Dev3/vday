Add your photos here!

Name them: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.

Then update: data/vday/photos.ts

Example:
export const photos = [
  "/vday/photos/1.jpg",
  "/vday/photos/2.jpg",
  "/vday/photos/3.jpg",
  "/vday/photos/4.jpg",
];

Recommended:
- At least 6-8 photos
- Good mix of portraits and candid shots
- High quality images (but will be optimized for web)
- Any aspect ratio works (will be cropped to fit)
