VALENTINE'S DAY ASSETS

This directory should contain the following files:

1. intro.mp4
   - Your intro video
   - Any duration (10-30 seconds recommended)
   - Will autoplay when entering the experience

2. song.mp3
   - Background music for the lyric scene
   - Match the duration with your lyrics.json timestamps
   - Should be a romantic song

3. photos/ directory
   - Add your photos as: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.
   - These will be used in:
     * Photo gallery
     * Slideshow during lyrics
     * Some scavenger hunt clues (if configured)
   - Recommended: 6-10 photos minimum

CURRENT STATUS:
- All directories are created
- Add your actual media files here
- Update data/vday/photos.ts with your photo list
- Update data/vday/lyrics.json with your song timing

The app will work even without these assets, but you'll see broken media.
For development, you can use placeholder content.
