  "Roses are red,\nViolets are blue,\nEvery day I'm grateful,\nFor a love like you.",
  "In your arms I found my home,\nIn your heart I found my peace,\nWith you beside me always,\nMy joy will never cease.",
  "Your laughter is my favorite song,\nYour smile my guiding light,\nWith you the days are beautiful,\nAnd magical each night.",
  "Through storms and sunshine we have grown,\nTogether hand in hand,\nOur love a journey shared with joy,\nMore than I could have planned."
